# FloppyDiskClock

This is the complete repository for RAYDIY's Floopy Disk Clock â€“ a huge 3.5 inch floppy disk which features an ePaper display to show current date, time and room temperature. 

## Features
- display time
- display date
- display current room temeprature with a DS18B20 temperature sensor
- auto screen rotation via quicksilver switch
- display your favorite games and program titles in a scratched out look (like we all did it in the 90s when we re-used disks)

This repo will include all the 3D printing files and code needed to re-build this master piece.

##NOTE
Currently the repo **is not complete**. When creating the next tutorial videos I will add the corresponding files to the repo. So be sure check back.
